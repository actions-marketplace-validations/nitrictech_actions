Nitric GitHub Actions streamlines workflow automation for Nitric CLI integration
within GitHub's hosted Actions runners. Nitric, accessible at
[nitric.io](https://nitric.io), extends its Command Line Interface (CLI) to
GitHub workflows, empowering the execution of diverse Nitric commands through
seamlessly integrated actions.

This action is designed to be run on `ubuntu-latest` due to limitations on MacOS
runners and Windows VMs. It ensures the installation and exposure of a specified
version of the Nitric CLI on the GitHub Actions runner environment.

## Usage

```yaml
name: Nitric
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  up:
    name: Update
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install and configure Pulumi üì¶
        uses: pulumi/actions@v4

      - name: Applying infrastructure üöÄ
        uses: nitrictech/actions@v1
        with:
          command: up
          stack-name: dev # replace with your stack
        env:
          PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE: ${{ secrets.PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE }}
          PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

This will check out the existing directory and run nitric up.

## Inputs

The actions supports the following inputs:

| Name         | Type   | Description                                                                                                                              | Default  | Required                  |

## Installation Only

If you want to only install the Nitric CLI, omit the `command` field of the
action.

```yaml
- uses: nitrictech/actions@v1
```

## Specific Version

A specific version of the `Nitric` CLI can be installed:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: nitrictech/actions@v1
    with:
      version: 1.33.3
```

## Examples

Below are some example workflows:

- [AWS](examples/aws.yaml)
- [Azure](examples/azure.yaml)
- [Google Cloud](examples/gcp.yaml)

## Develop

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash

```

Run the tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Release

To publish the action, we use
[JasonEtco/build-and-tag-action](https://github.com/JasonEtco/build-and-tag-action).
This automates the build and tagging process.

```bash
